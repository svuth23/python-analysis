## Features
It provides a text summery for election and budget data analysis

- **Data Handling**: Our Python scripts effectively read and analyze large CSV files.
- **Data Export**: Results are displayed in both the terminal and saved in text files for easy reference.
- **Modular Approach**: Projects are structured with for loops, function definitions, lists, dictionaries, if statements, addition assignment, and basic arithmetic.

## PyBank

**Description**: In PyBank, we assist a financial records company in analyzing their budget. We were provided with 'budget_data.csv,' a dataset with 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses' columns.

**Objectives**:
- Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
- Determine the net total amount of 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period.
- Analyze the changes in 'Profit/Losses' over time and compute the average of those changes.
- Identify the greatest increase in profits (including the date and amount).
- Calculate the greatest decrease in profits (including the date and amount).

**Flexibility**: Our script is designed to easily accommodate additional months added to the dataset. Simply re-run the script to update the analysis.

**PyBank Results**: A capture of the output showcases the insights obtained through PyBank analysis.

## PyPoll

**Description**: In PyPoll, we are analyzing poll data from 'election_data.csv,' which contains 'Voter ID,' 'County,' and 'Candidate' columns.

**Objectives**:
- Determine the total number of votes cast.
- Compile a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Compute the total number of votes each candidate won.
- Declare the winner of the election based on popular vote.

**Scalability**: Our script is designed to seamlessly adapt to future polls with different datasets. It extracts candidate names from the data and stores votes cast for each candidate in a dictionary.

**Potential Improvements**: The script could be further improved to allow users to select the data file they wish to analyze, with the help of libraries 

**PyPoll Results**: A snapshot of the output demonstrates the election results obtained through PyPoll analysis.
